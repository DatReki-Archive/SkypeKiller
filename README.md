# A program that stops Skype running in the background
Ever noticed how with the newest Windows updates Skype is showing up on the system tray?
Even if you disable it from showing up on the system tray it will keep running in the background
That's why I made this program to stop it from running

# Different versions
## .exe
Just a simple batch script converted to an silent .exe using [Bat To Exe Converter](http://www.f2ko.de/en/b2e.php).
## Batch
The batch script that was used for the .exe. If you wish to look at the code or don't want to run it as an .exe or want to compile it yourself this option is for you!
## C#
Was working on a C# version however this sadly doesn't work as of yet
### C# CMD
Runs it from a silent CMD window
### C# Batch
Runs it from a batch file
